# Traveling Salesman Problem Solver
### Description
This project is a Java application that solves the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using a combination of the nearest neighbor algorithm and the genetic algorithm. The TSP is a classic optimization problem where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the original city.

### Features
Implements the nearest neighbor algorithm to construct an initial solution.
Applies a genetic algorithm to further optimize the initial solution and find the best route.
Reads city coordinates from input files of different sizes.
Displays the optimal route and cost value.
Calculates the execution time of the algorithm.

### Requirements
Java Development Kit (JDK)
Eclipse IDE or any Java development environment
